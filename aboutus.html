        <blockquote>
            <p>Humans have always liked telling stories. It is a primal desire, one that has led to the creation of the various mythologies, epics, and all the art that surrounds us. The ability to capture the abstractions of our mind through words and drawings which then inspire ideas within others is what separates humans from all other living beings. We are almost limitless in our capability for self-expression. We have developed countless channels for self-expression over the years, be they sculptures, paintings, poems, dance forms, songs or, in our case, magazines! </br></br>

                Quarks is IISc’s undergraduate magazine. But what does that actually mean? To us, Quarks is a way of communication. It is a statement we make collectively, a snapshot capturing various facets of the lives of the Undergraduate students in IISc. Since its inception in 2012, Quarks has offered the IISc community and the world a glimpse into undergraduate life at the institute. As one of the oldest UG initiatives, it has mirrored the growth of the program, chronicling many firsts that came with it – the first major selection, the first Mimamsa victory, the first college fest and the first graduation ceremony. And with them, it has captured the enthusiasm that comes with starting something new, being the pioneers staring into the unknown, along with their fears and uncertainties.</br></br>
                
                While the UG program is still ‘new’, it is no longer in its infancy. We are preceded by a long line of seniors and alumni who have set the standard of what the Undergraduates of IISc can achieve. We must acknowledge the contributions made by them and look at how our actions will influence the UG program in the years to come. Through Quarks, we hope to be able to capture these efforts as honestly as we can. And what better way to achieve this than to collect the stories from the people currently within the program? </br></br>
                
                We need your help to achieve this. Tell us your stories! Tell us what you think at night before you go to sleep, tell us what you are passionate about, tell us about the best and worst days of your life, express yourself in any meaningful way possible. There is no limitation to language, length, genre or topic. If you aren’t fond of writing, draw something, or send us a picture! Send us a poorly drawn comic, or a list of dad jokes you really like, or a description of how you feel when you finally submit all your pending assignments on Teams. </br></br>
                
                Channel your creativity and let Quarks be your platform! We are here to watch and learn. </br></br> 
                Thanks and Regards, <br>
                Aviral Sood (Coordinator) <br>
