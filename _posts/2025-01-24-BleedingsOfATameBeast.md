<div style="text-align: center;">

I am tame now â€“<br>  
Tame and sane.<br>  
I will not paint any more<br>  
In the nauseous shades of red.<br>  
No more shall I paint the blood<br>  
That I bleed every day;<br>  
Every moment a lathi charge is unleashed,<br>  
An encounter is ensued,<br>  
A curse is hurled.<br>  
No more shall I paint the blood<br>  
Trickling from the vagina of the girl<br>  
Stuffed with pebbles.<br>  
They say she was a naxal.<br>  
No more shall I paint the rubble that lay<br>  
In Syria, speckled with the blood of a son,<br>  
Caressed by the roughened fingers of a widowed<br>  
husband,<br>  
No more shall I paint the entrails of<br>  
Lahore, split apart by a bomb-blast.<br>  
No more.<br>  
I am tame now.<br>  
Tame and sane.<br>  
I shall but spit,<br>  
And spit blood<br>  
And speckle the walls in red.<br>  

</div>
