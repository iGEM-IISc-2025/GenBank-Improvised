Poet: Subhanan Banerjee


<div style="text-align: center;">

The scientist told his best friend<br>  
With gladness in his eyes<br>  
"You'll change my heart with the one<br>  
That I've myself designed."<br><br>  

Something no one has done before<br>  
On any ocean apart lands<br>  
A heart made by an amateur brain<br>  
To be placed by amateur hands.<br><br>  

He did not feel the fear of death<br>  
Nor his friend doubted, he could<br>  
From all around, people came to see<br>  
How a heartless man would look.<br><br>  

He confided to the doctor then<br>  
That his love is at God's hunt<br>  
His martial heart that gymed a lot<br>  
Will let her live till she wants.<br><br>  

"Invention for the disguised heartsâ€”<br>  
You will resurrect them all<br><br>  

Under this heaven, you will be<br>  
The greatest of all, my pal..."
