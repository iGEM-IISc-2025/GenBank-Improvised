<div style="text-align: center;">

And there we lay -<br>  
Our souls entwined,<br>  
Our bodies at waste;<br>  
Passion lay dead in the tracks trodden by habit.<br>  

You wouldn’t know.<br>  
All words of love<br>  
That had done us mellow –<br>  
Colourful as the spring and sprightly as a swallow<br>  
They seem now to be<br>  
But the burnt remains of a plundered bee-hive,<br>  
In black decay.<br>  

All words of passion<br>  
That could arouse us<br>  
And let us loose as if a raging Spanish bull;<br>  
All fantasies of the most beautiful and the artful,<br>  
now left none but thin air<br>  
Reeking of the rotten carcasses<br>  
Of our once-throbbing hearts.<br>  

Every bullet,<br>  
Every slogan,<br>  
That had once set our faith aflame –<br>  
Left nothing but grey ash.<br>  

We lay in waste.<br>  
You wouldn’t know.<br>  

It was not a graveyard<br>  
Sombre in death,<br>  
For<br>  

Every word truly once felt<br>  
Now hung heavy<br>  
In the mesh of dead poetry –<br>  
Rotting,<br>  
The pungent stench keeping the decaying bodies<br>  
Alive in disuse and waste<br>  
In the graveyard of dead poets.<br>  

</div>
