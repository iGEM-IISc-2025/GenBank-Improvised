Someone once told me that if I was the smartest person in a room, I was in the
wrong room. It was quite easy to say I believed in this until I had to face a complete
change in environment. As someone who quite easily made it to the far right of
any class yet, I had never really put myself in the shoes of the far left.

I understand now that it is, in every sense, belittling to be someone who actually
pulls the average down. The initial days were a crash course on how wrong I was
on a lot of counts, especially about myself. The calm and composed world I had
built around me came crashing down. I was drowning even before I realized I was
not on solid ground. Even worse, when I realized I was drowning, my thoughts
were not about how to swim. I was confused about why I was drowning in
the first place. Again, someone had told me that it was good to be confused,
with a caveat: you should think about how you can solve the problem.

Against instinct, I stopped struggling and decided to plummet to the
bottom, knowing that the answers to my questions were definitely
not on the surface. The answers I came upon were simple but
not easy to digest. The calm and composed world Iâ€™d built for
myself had foundations of hypocrisy. It was time to tear
the world down as I had known it. It took a fairly long
time, but my world was up again, this time on firm,
solid ground with foundations of raw truth and
adversity. I guess it took a bit of anarchy
and chaos to bring world order.
