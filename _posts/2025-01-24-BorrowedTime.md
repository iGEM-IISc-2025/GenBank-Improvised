<div style="text-align: center;">

Baba is in the neighbourhood, Ammi in her sleep<br>  
tells me it’s that time of day<br>  
you sit down and you keep<br>  
a book of prayers and a tray of leaves<br>  
before the wall with a window. A long shadow<br>  
will fall behind you from the rising moon,<br>  
unless it is one of those pitch-dark evenings.<br>  

The choking city is dressed up<br>  
like a night queen’s secret,<br>  
the hair she’s let down the back of her neck<br>  
and her travelling spine, spill it. And<br>  
the moon will show up in time on your face,<br>  
I have told myself, and this is my time: in the wake<br>  
of an approaching darkness and a blind thunderstorm,<br>  
in the warmth and the borrowed quietness of this hour,<br>  
this moment takes on a mysterious and godly form, and now<br>  
I like to play my little game, my fortune<br>  
that is my imagination.<br>  

History blossoms as poetry<br>  
out of a bottle of wars we would sooner forget.<br>  
Proceed, says the wildflower, do not pause<br>  
to be respectful today:<br>  
by the poolside and the marketplace,<br>  
armies erase the future of memories,<br>  
and the touch of shelter or love is not welcome.<br>  

The world I see is empty of everything<br>  
that crowds and makes business<br>  
of nothing in the middle of nowhere.<br>  
Undetailed and still, the sky waits,<br>  
serenades and the roof of your mouth and the floor of the sky<br>  
sit idle. I imagine nothing. Until—<br>  
for little soldiers like me,<br>  
every fancy thought that flies is<br>  
denied and tied to a tall pole of reality;<br>  
there is no poetry I can give you,<br>  
nor any poetry you can give me.<br>  

I look at the pale and thin clouds, I do<br>  
not realise why they graze in an open sky:<br>  
no rain, no sorrow, no music<br>  
pierces this polythene sky,<br>  
but with all that beauty of this butter-cream season<br>  
some rhythms and patterns spell out—<br>  
what reaches me with the spirit of a solitary poem.<br>  

Now slowly,<br>  
with the burning and boiling, the spoils and the rampage<br>  
in our little hearts see no light,<br>  
at least these starved skies tell me so;<br>  
our lives short for so much sorrow—<br>  
(no, forsake the flutter in your head!<br>  
the rioters do not rest, they do not dream, why should you?)<br>  

In the middle of our consciousness that flows like a poem,<br>  
are you not interrupted, with a feeling that all<br>  
time is obese and unrelated to you, that perhaps one should just greet nothing, wait for nothing,—<br>  
not the curfew, not Rashid’s call, not the rain?<br>  

What is deliverance for me today<br>  
will be unbearable in just another day,<br>  
what’s swinging must cease to sway and rhyme happily.<br>  
The unquiet, hesitant, the nervous and silent us—<br>  
we struggle for a page from the library of time, but—<br>  
my imagination is a child,<br>  
and we cannot imagine much beyond our limitations; but, but, but neither can you, and you won’t let anyone pinch you.<br>  

Orange peels sweat, crows drown the azan,<br>  
the blood in the sky clots, only a memory of the scar<br>  
looks down through a moonbeam<br>  
as I feel my face, my face feels my palms<br>  
with a returning anxiety, a oneness with the crows and the citrus scent<br>  
consumes me; I am quite an hourglass you see—<br>  
when I emerge, Baba is back, Ammi still sleeps.<br>
