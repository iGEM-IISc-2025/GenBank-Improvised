# First Years' first experiences

"The only constant in life is change" is a timeless truth, yet many struggle to accept it. Change disrupts comfort zones, challenges beliefs, and brings uncertainty, making people resistant to it. Whether it's personal growth, technological advancements, or societal shifts, the fear of the unknown often holds individuals back. So, why should you leave your comfort zone, your sweet little home, and come to IISc? What does coming here even entail? What does it feel like? Is it a good choice for someone like me? <br>
To find the answers to these challenging questions, we decided to interview our batchmates- the freshmen. The kids that just completed their high school, fought the tough battle of competitive exams, and firmly decided to join IISc, The Indian Institute of Science, and make it their new home. Well, we as freshmen ourselves, won that battle with flying colours, but… we did not know what to expect next, what was coming for us, and how it will go. And thus, the tussle with change began.<br>
And now that we are at the end of our first year in IISc, it is time to reflect…
<br><br>
“So, what was coming to IISc like? What was the experience of coming here like?”<br>
 It is obvious from the vivid and passionate responses to this question that life at IISc is, to say the least, is quite interesting. “When I just came to campus, there was a lot of uncertainty about how I’ll make friends, and how the campus will be, and whether I’ll be able to cope...”, a student recalled. For most of them, it was THE first-time experience. First time living in a hostel, first time being surrounded by such a highly intelligent peer group, first time staying away from their parents… and what not. “There were a lot of challenges. How will I manage my own room? Can I ever score well here?”, questions like this bothered all of them. But often, reality is much less agonizing than our imaginations, and the students learned this the easy way. THE IISc WAY.
According to most responses, it seems the IISc way is a smooth and rewarding transition. “The transition to IISc was pretty smooth”, many said, “seniors were very helpful”. Indeed, most students agreed that the seniors were the key ingredient in cooking the experience.<br>
On the contrary, students reported that one of the bitter points was the management on the day of the admission, with many people commenting on how the entire process was a huge avoidable mess.
<br><br>
“But why come to IISc in the first place?”
For many, the answer was simple. It was their dream institute. IISc has a legacy that motivates people to join, be it the great scientists like CV Raman and Homi Bhabha that roamed its corridors or be it its current stature as the most premier research institute in India. The idea of walking in the same corridors excited people, and their passion for science and research drove their decision to join IISc.<br>
Well, for me, I had the option to take up a B.Tech. degree and pursue Computer Science Engineering at IIT Bombay, but living a 9-5 life was a repulsive idea. The way I wanted my life to be was driven by curiosity, filled with endless questions, and devoted to uncovering answers that no one had found before.<br>
