Life at IISc is a vibrant fabric in which the threads of so many lives come together. To us students, if “all
the world’s a stage”, no longer is a teacher the only central character in our daily lives.

From being saved at the brink of starvation by the Tuck Shop or printing out entire lab reports (which
are all virtuously original, with no manipulation of data, of course) at the Campus Xerox Centre, we’ve
seen it all; done it all. But despite all the times Kabini indulges our laziness to walk all the way to mess,
and the Cycle Repair Shop is our salvation, we often hurry past the people who make it possible. The
sheer amount of time they might have spent in the haven that is IISc, the stories they might be teeming
with, is overlooked.

So, in 2018, Quarks decided to do exactly that: we ferreted around after these guardian angels,
(annoying them to no end), only to stumble upon story after story; reminiscence upon reminiscence; life upon life.

### **Mr. Seetharam: Tuck Shop Owner**
Mr Seetharam is literally the one true knight-inshining-armour to all undergraduates in distress.
One of the most famous people among the UG populace, Seetharam aka. Tuck Shop Uncle,
started off with his business at IISc about 10
years ago. A resident of Bangalore for nearly 16
years, he has seen the undergrads right from the
beginnings of the program.

Taking off only on Sundays and in case of some
unexpected emergency, Mr. Seetharam has all the
essentials that students need, as he himself says,
“I have everything from pins to pens.” He says
students who study till late in the night and end
up missing their breakfast (read every UG student
ever) usually come to his shop, and so he always
keeps fresh stock of sandwiches and burgers.
For the convenience of his customers, who are
majorly students, Mr. Seetharam accepts not just
cash but also online payment; moreover he is
affectionate enough to let students buy on credit.

With a good expertise in Kannada, over years, he
has learnt English, Hindi and a bit of basic Bengali,
Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam and spends his free
time reading newspapers or books. As a hobby,
he practices Palmistry and Astrology.
The Tuck Shop is indeed an oasis for us hapless,
hungry (not to mention, broke) undergrads.

### **Mr. Narasimhaiya: Cycle Repair Shop owner**
As students of IISc (ahem - motorised vehicles are
banned - ahem), we simply cannot do without our
cycles or cycle servicing. For the past six years or
so, Narasimhaiya has been here for us every
day of the year. Native to Bangalore, cycle
repairing became his profession by tradition.
His thirty-five years of experience in the
profession notwithstanding, Narasimhaiya feels
privileged for having his business at IISc. While
he stays engrossed in his cycles all day, he enjoys
interacting with his customers, especially the
students. He is a perfectionist and admits that he
takes more time to service the cycles for the same
reason.

While he sometimes feels he could have had
a more flourishing business elsewhere, he
considers being at IISc a privilege, and says the
job satisfaction here in unparalleled.

### **Mr. Ravi: Kabini Canteen**
“You can never spend more than Rs. 100 per
person at Kabini” is a dictum of the holy scriptures.
Kidding of course, but it is a universal truth no
less.

The canteen has been running for around eight
years and has served everyone; students and staff
alike. In the manager, Mr. Ravi’s own words, “it is
one of the places where you get good food at an
extremely subsidised price. Despite a limited
menu, it remains one of the most popular student
eateries.”

For all the times we did not want to walk to mess
for meals, for every curse we have hurled at the
geniuses who planted the messes so infernally far
away, Kabini is our solace.

### **Mr.Janardhan: Notebook Drive**
Starting 14 years ago, Mr. Janardhan has helped
Notebook Drive every year by driving his rental
truck out to schools to distribute notebooks to
local schools for the underprivileged. Covering up
to 10 schools per day, he is a shining example of
how the aam aadmi make a difference to another
human life.

“We’re given a list of schools every day, along with
the books to be delivered by NBD. We just plan
out our route so that we hit each school within
their session timings and finish the distribution
as quickly as possible”, he says. “Even if we get
higher pay, even ₹10,000 elsewhere, I always
bring my truck here first during that week,
regardless of the fare.”

He has even delivered computers to schools in the
previous years, amongst other material for the
benefit of the school children’s education. His
collaborative efforts with the NBD are truly
invaluable.

### **Mr. Ravichandran: Xerox Center**
While Ravichandran has been at IISc, for more
than three decades, the Campus Xerox Centre has
only (only!) been running for the past twenty
years. He started out at a draftsman, (after having
completed a year of apprenticeship at the BEL) at
the Electrical Engineering Department. He then
had a two year stint at the JRD Tata Memorial
Library whereupon he was encouraged to open a
Xerox Centre; it was sorely needed.

The tidal waves of change he has seen “are not
little, it has been change upon change”. He starts
with how almost everything is now electronic
and automated, rather than manual and walks us
through the analog-to-digital revolution. “Every
technology (from the glory days of the typewriter
and liquid Xerox to those of floppy disks, CDs),
every process has undergone a drastic shift.”

Simply in terms of manpower, at the beginning,
Ravichandran employed twelve to thirteen
operators. This was required as the facilities were
so primitive; something as simple as back to back
printing had to be manually fed twice and
inverted. Ten copies would have to be printed out
manually as many times. “Technology has now
advanced such that a single person can handle
three to four machines- in fact I handle as many
myself” he chortles.

Then with a sombre expression, he says “As a
result of all these advancements, a student’s
thesis gets printed, bound and done with in a
span of two hours. Back then, it would be a two
month affair. A real relationship would develop
with each student.”

Even as he speaks, a student gives her thesis on a
pen drive and asks him in broken Kannada if she
can collect it the next day. He replies in the
affirmative (in perfect English, might I add) and
out she walks.

He continues, the nostalgia heavy in his voice,
“They (the students) would bring a couple of
pages each day, handwritten. They would sit with
me and dictate as I keyed it in, rectifying mistakes
along the way. They would then go back and show the day’s draft to their professor, get it corrected.
Then return the next day with edits and more
pages to key in. Once the final copy was keyed in,
they would get multiple Xeroxes of it.”

He speaks of the trifling troubles they faced too:
for the cover page of the thesis, they required
“glossy” papers called dressing sheets that were
only available with a vendor outside campus;
getting the cover printed was a three day affair.
Moreover, different fonts were not possible as all
the typing was done with one typewriter; one
need only look at old documents in the library
archives for evidence.

He then speaks of how mathematical symbols
were printed, a slightly cumbersome matter to
this day. It is in equal amounts both, appalling
and amazing. In the typewriter, there would be
a feature to insert different “wheels” containing
various special symbols. A Dizzee wheel was one
that contained mathematical symbols. So, for a
simple ‘α’, one could either write it out manually everywhere it appeared (for brackets, this was the
only option), or even more painstakingly: type it
out multiple times with the wheel, cut each one of
them out into tiny pieces and paste it everywhere
it appeared.

He then goes on to speak about typesetting,
hailing LaTeX _“your generation is so privileged,
you even have some software to format your stuff
for you!”_ , while reminiscing about how it used
to be: initially in typewriters, there was no right
justification, neither was there any proportional
spacing between the letters, i.e. the letters ‘i’
and ‘w’ would take the same amount of space.
This increased the paper usage by almost two
times. Moreover, pasting bits and pieces like the
aforementioned ‘α’ added to the overall bulk of a
document.

The sheer human labour leaves us incredulous.
The above begs the question, what did one do
for graphs back then? Ravichandran is a trained
mechanical draftsman; he would therefore take
the rough scribbles students would bring and
draw a neat, proportional graph by hand. Multiple
copies would then then taken via Xeroxing.
In such cases, he also used stencils in a technique
called stencil cutting and duplicating to trace out
alphabets onto the graph (they couldn’t be
keyed in with a typewriter). Requisite “slots”
(silhouettes) would be cut out; rolled up and ink
passed through.

He then says, with pride strengthening his voice, “I must have seen thousands of theses in my life so
far, so intimately. I would even be acknowledged
in the document. So many students have now
become big professors and hold prominent
administrative positions. Many of them even
come back sometimes, make small talk. You see,
they do not forget.”

From when he was working well past midnight as
a draftsman at Electrical Engineering or slaving
over a student’s thesis to handling four machines
single-handedly, Ravichandran’s single-minded
dedication to his work is very apparent. It has
even rubbed off on his assistants too; “the boys
are so sincere that they are reluctant to take off
even on festivals and holidays”.

He then takes a trip down IIScian memory
lane: “The IISc of thirty-five years ago was very
different. There was only one tiny hostel for
women then. Initially, we set up the Xerox Centre
at Gymkhana. But then on popular demand”, he
grins, “we moved to a more accessible place:
Union Office, near Nesara. Then, twenty years
ago, we moved to this location.”

Like every baby boomer, he too takes a minute
and goes on the “aaj kal ke bacche” rant. He
speaks of the increasing impatience in Gen Y. He
laments the loss of skill too: of penmanship and
artistry- “especially as a draftsman, it is saddening
to see this. We used so many instruments, for
so many different types of drawings: isometric,
orthogonal… It is all obsolete now, in a time when
everything is increasingly being taken for granted”
The wistfulness is still apparent as Ravichandran
yet again says “we used to work together with the
students. I literally and metaphorically had a
hand in their theses. Four hours a day would be
devoted to solely this. Students would often take
me out for a stroll and some tea at the end of a
day’s grueling work”. Even as he speaks, he is
finished with binding another manuscript.
“Well, this is how your Campus Xerox Centre has
come to be. This is how I’ve spent my whole life: at IISc.”
