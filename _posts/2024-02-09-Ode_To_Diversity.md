<div style="text-align: center;">


As long as the sky embraces<br>  
In its blue the green of Earth<br>  
Do we live of diverse songs, yet<br>  
All we men of the same blood.<br><br>  

Though miles apart, strange or odd<br>  
All we men of the same God<br>  
All we do defeat or feat<br>  
In truth builds, soul's kins' abode.<br><br>  

Tulips bloom and rain caresses<br>  
Our only homeland earth<br>  
There remains fences no longer<br>  
In between our waking hearts.<br><br>  

Though we speak in different words<br>  
Still we part of a happy world<br>  
All we do defeat or feat<br>  
In truth builds, soul's kins' abode.
