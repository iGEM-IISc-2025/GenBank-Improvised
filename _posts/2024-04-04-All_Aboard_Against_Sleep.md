<div style="text-align: center;">

When the lull of sleep<br>  
is not sleepy enough,<br>  
when the nausea is too timid<br>  
to slay the mind's demons,<br>  
an insipid aftertaste in the mouth —<br>  
into that sleepless night —<br>  
the darkest hour —<br>  
a rainbow — dainty yet resplendent —<br>  
paints itself<br>  
into the restive canvas of the mind.<br>  

<br><br>

My rainbow transcends the darkness —<br>  
And soars high —<br>  
Colors soaking up all the hue<br>  
My weary mind can brew.<br>  
And in that transient rhapsody,<br>  
I play muse to my own imagination —<br>  
as it does to me —<br>  
And in its own reflective biome,<br>  
the creation defines itself —<br>  
just as it defines me.<br>  

<br><br>

Where does the hue come from?<br>  
Is it the intoxication<br>  
from all the light of the day —<br>  
unfolding into the night?<br>  
An intoxication marred by life —<br>  
promise of renewed mirth<br>  
under the sun —<br>  
the rise and fall of the tides —<br>  
the diurnal magic<br>  
that tonight's stygian darkness<br>  
can dare not hide.<br>  

</div>
